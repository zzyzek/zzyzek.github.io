* [Metropolis theme for beamer](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) ([overleaf](https://github.com/matze/mtheme))
  - [demo](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/beamer-contrib/themes/metropolis/demo/demo.pdf), [source](https://github.com/matze/mtheme/blob/master/demo/demo.tex)
* [SO: embedding videos in beamer](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1574/embedding-videos-and-animations)
* [beamer doc](https://ctan.math.washington.edu/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/beamer/doc/beameruserguide.pdf)
* [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) (cross and hourglass are both cc0 but I got them from here)

Okular can be used to see videos embedded.
Note that the videos have to appear on the filesystem as they appear in the LaTeX file (I have them in a `vid/` subdirectory relative to the slides)
